This project will help you to link your git project to redmine.

The project structure should be :

master - release branch
devel  - where all integration goes
redmine-TRACKER-ID-SLUD - all synchronized task
pr-YYYMMDDHHmmSS-SLUG - all the pull request receive when a task is finished

Developers should have the right to push redmine-* and pr-*.
Reviewer should have the right to read redmine-* (and write on it), push to devel and remove the pr-*.
Integrator should have the right to merge devel into master and create a tag 'vVERSION' on each release.

You need to patch your redmine, to be able to setup project :

diff --git a/app/views/projects/show.api.rsb b/app/views/projects/show.api.rsb
index a6f26f8..f1fdfa9 100644
