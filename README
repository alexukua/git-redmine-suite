This project will help you to link your git project to redmine.

The project structure should be :

master - release branch
devel  - where all integration goes
redmine-TRACKER-ID-SLUD - all synchronized task
pr-YYYMMDDHHmmSS-SLUG - all the pull request receive when a task is finished

Developers should have the right to push redmine-* and pr-*.
Reviewer should have the right to read redmine-* (and write on it), push to devel and remove the pr-*.
Integrator should have the right to merge devel into master and create a tag 'vVERSION' on each release.

Redmine need to be patched, and you need to add GIT_REPOS, GIT_PR, GIT_RELEASE as global custom fields (all project).
GIT_REPOS need to be searchable / filterable.

You also need to setup a default time entry (ex: Development), in Enumeration tab.

You need to patch your redmine, to be able to setup project : see grs.patch
