This project will help you to link your git project to redmine.

The project structure should be :

master - release branch
devel  - where all integration goes
redmine-task-ID-SLUD - all synchronized task
pr-YYYMMDDHHmmSS-SLUG - all the pull request receive when a task is finished

Developers should have the right to push redmine-task-* and pr-*.
Reviewer should have the right to merge redmine-task-* to devel and remove the pr-*.
Integrator should have the right to merge devel into master and create a tag 'vVERSION' on each release.
