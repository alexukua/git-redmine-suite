=head1 SETUP GUIDE

Welcome to the setup guide.

This guide lead you to :

 * understand the link between redmine and your git repositories
 * setup git redmine
 * manager redmine project in your git repository

=head1 EXPLANATION

Redmine is composed of projects. Each project can have multiple git repositories.

For example, you have project TEST with :

 * ORM
 * Collect
 * Compute
 * ...

Each git repository may have a different reviewers.

If you have a task in redmine that lead to change multiple git repositories, you have to create one subtask per git repository.

Each start/finish will update the task in redmine.

=head1 REDMINE GLOBAL AUTO SETUP

You can use a profile to setup your redmine.

This will setup all keys for you, in git config --global.

The command :

 * git redmine setup global

This will list you the profile available. Now only "weborama" and "celogeek" is present.

To complete the auto setup :

 * git redmine setup global weborama AUTH_KEY

The AUTH_KEY can be found in your account in redmine. Under "API access key", click on "Show", copy paste the key.

=head1 REDMINE LOCAL AUTO SETUP

You can also setup your auth key for one git project only.

It the same as "global", but with "local".

 * git redmine setup local weborama AUTH_KEY

=head1 REDMINE MANUEL SETUP

The best way to know what you have to do, is to run a command.

 * git redmine task pending

The first is to setup the "auth_key" and the "url" of the server :

 * git config --global redmine.authkey YOUR_AUTH_KEY
 * git config --global redmine.url THE_REDMINE_URL_SERVER

Warning, to use a "HTTPS" url in redmine you MUST have a VALID CERTIFICAT !

If you are looking for one, you can get one freely on L<https://www.startssl.com/>.

Then run the command again to file the next step :

 * git redmine task pending

You have to setup the ids of statuses. It will allow the tools to setup the status of the task properl :

 * git config --global redmine.statuses.task.assigned ID
 * => The ID of the status when a task is assigned to you.

 * git config --global redmine.statuses.task.inprogress ID
 * => The ID of the status when you are working on a task.

 * git config --global redmine.statuses.review.assigned ID
 * => The ID of the status when a task need a review by you.

 * git config --global redmine.statuses.review.inprogress ID
 * => The ID of the status when a task is currently review by you.

 * git config --global redmine.statuses.release.assigned ID
 * => The ID of the status when a task has to be released by you.

 * git config --global redmine.statuses.release.finish ID
 * => The ID of the status when a task has been released.

You can then run the command again :

 * git redmine task pending

You need to tell which ID is you. They is only one possibility. It will be display above.

 * git config --global redmine.user.id ID

The command should work now.

 * git redmine task pending

But display nothing. This is normal you have to setup project for that.

=head1 PROJECT SETUP

The project need 3 custom fields to be compatible with Git Redmine Suite : GIT_REPOS, GIT_PR, GIT_RELEASE.

The task management will use it to save meta information.

 * GIT_REPOS should be a text field with "Used as a filter" and "Searchable" checked.
 * GIT_PR should be a text.
 * GIT_RELEASE should be a text.

You can add them "For all project". Otherwise the search will be a little bit slower due to Redmine issue on that.
